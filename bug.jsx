This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS classes to style a simple component. However, there might be an issue if the `hover` state does not work as expected. This could be because of a few reasons:

* **Missing or incorrect configuration:** Tailwind CSS must be correctly installed and configured in your project. If the configuration is missing or wrong, the `hover` state classes won't work.
* **Parent element interference:** The parent element's styling might interfere with the `hover` state. For instance, a parent element might have `pointer-events: none` or something similar.  
* **Conflicting CSS:**  Other CSS rules could override Tailwind's styles. Using !important should be avoided if possible but may be necessary to check if it is a conflict.
* **JavaScript interference:** Any JavaScript code manipulating the component's classes or styles could override Tailwind CSS.
* **Incorrect class names:** A simple typo in the class name can stop the hover state from working.  Double check the class names used are correct and conform to Tailwind's conventions.
* **Missing `@tailwind` directives:**  If you're not using the JIT mode of Tailwind, make sure you include `@tailwind base`, `@tailwind components`, and `@tailwind utilities` in your CSS file.
